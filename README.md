For this assignment I created a web portfolio for myself in order to display my skills and projects to possible employers.

Steps:

    Create the html that will be the base for the portfolio.
    Enter in the categories for the page that includes About, Projects, Contact, and link to a Resume.
    Start working on the design in the style sheet and make it accessible on smaller screen sizes.
    Make sure that the links in the header are working.
    Added effects on hover to project images.
